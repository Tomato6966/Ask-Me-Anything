I get questions by email, occasionally. This way anyone can read the answer!

[![Ask Me Anything !](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ask%20me-anything-1abc9c.svg)](https://GitHub.com/Naereen/ama)

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code.
Cooking. Traveling. Sports. Teaching. Pokémon. Whatever. :joy:

### :memo: Guidelines

 - :mag: Ensure your question has not already been answered.
 - :memo: Use a succinct title and description.
 - :bug: Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker (i.e., on the issue tracker of the corresponding [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/lbesson/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/Naereen/) repository).
 - :signal_strength: Support questions are better asked on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and maths questions on [Math Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/).
 - :blush: Be nice, civil and polite ([as always](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/)).
 - :heart_eyes: If you include at least one emoji in your question, the feedback might come faster!
